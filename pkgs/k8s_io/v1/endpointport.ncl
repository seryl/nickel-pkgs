  # EndpointPort is a tuple that describes a single port. Deprecated: This API is deprecated in v1.33+.
  EndpointPort = {
    appProtocol | optional | String | doc m%"
The application protocol for this port. This is used as a hint for implementations to offer richer behavior for protocols that they understand. This field follows standard Kubernetes label syntax. Valid values are either:

* Un-prefixed protocol names - reserved for IANA standard service names (as per RFC-6335 and https://www.iana.org/assignments/service-names).

* Kubernetes-defined prefixed names:
  * 'kubernetes.io/h2c' - HTTP/2 prior knowledge over cleartext as described in https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9113.html#name-starting-http-2-with-prior-
  * 'kubernetes.io/ws'  - WebSocket over cleartext as described in https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6455
  * 'kubernetes.io/wss' - WebSocket over TLS as described in https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6455

* Other protocols should use implementation-defined prefixed names such as mycompany.com/my-custom-protocol.
"%,
    name | optional | String | doc m%"
The name of this port.  This must match the 'name' field in the corresponding ServicePort. Must be a DNS_LABEL. Optional only if one port is defined.
"%,
    port | Number | doc "The port number of the endpoint.",
    protocol | optional | String | doc "The IP protocol for this port. Must be UDP, TCP, or SCTP. Default is TCP.",
  },
}

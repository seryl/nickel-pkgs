    apiVersion | optional | String | doc m%"
APIVersion defines the versioned schema of this representation of an object.
Servers should convert recognized schemas to the latest internal value, and
may reject unrecognized values.

"%,
    kind | optional | String | doc m%"
Kind is a string value representing the REST resource this object represents.
Servers may infer this from the endpoint the client submits requests to.
Cannot be updated.

Argument value, e.g. 30s. Can be empty for name-only arguments (e.g. --storage.tsdb.no-lockfile)
"%,

AdditionalArgs allows setting additional arguments for the 'prometheus' container.

It is intended for e.g. activating hidden flags which are not supported by
the dedicated configuration options yet. The arguments are passed as-is to the
Prometheus container which may cause issues if they are invalid or not supported
by the given Prometheus version.

In case of an argument conflict (e.g. an argument which is already set by the
operator itself) or when providing an invalid argument, the reconciliation will
fail and an error will be logged.

allowed to be empty. Instances of this type with an empty value here are

AdditionalScrapeConfigs allows specifying a key of a Secret containing
additional Prometheus scrape configurations. Scrape configurations
specified are appended to the configurations generated by the Prometheus
Operator. Job configurations specified must have the form as specified
in the official Prometheus documentation:
https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/configuration/configuration/#scrape_config.
As scrape configs are appended, the user is responsible to make sure it
is valid. Note that using this feature may expose the possibility to
break upgrades of Prometheus. It is advised to review Prometheus release
notes to ensure that no incompatible scrape configs are going to break
Prometheus after the upgrade.

MatchLabelKeys is a set of pod label keys to select which pods will
be taken into consideration. The keys are used to lookup values from the
incoming pod labels, those key-value labels are merged with `labelSelector` as `key in (value)`
to select the group of existing pods which pods will be taken into consideration
for the incoming pod's pod (anti) affinity. Keys that don't exist in the incoming
pod labels will be ignored. The default value is empty.
The same key is forbidden to exist in both matchLabelKeys and labelSelector.
Also, matchLabelKeys cannot be set when labelSelector isn't set.

When a ServiceMonitor's endpoint specifies a `bearerTokenFile` value
(e.g.  '/var/run/secrets/kubernetes.io/serviceaccount/token'), a
malicious target can get access to the Prometheus service account's
token in the Prometheus' scrape request. Setting
`spec.arbitraryFSAccessThroughSM` to 'true' would prevent the attack.
Users should instead provide the credentials using the
`spec.bearerTokenSecret` field.

"%,
        restartPolicy | optional | String | doc m%"
RestartPolicy defines the restart behavior of individual containers in a pod.
This field may only be set for init containers, and the only allowed value is "Always".
For non-init containers or when this field is not specified,
the restart behavior is defined by the Pod's restart policy and the container type.
Setting the RestartPolicy as "Always" for the init container will have the following effect:
this init container will be continually restarted on
exit until all regular containers have terminated. Once all regular
containers have completed, all init containers with restartPolicy "Always"
will be shut down. This lifecycle differs from normal init containers and
is often referred to as a "sidecar" container. Although this init
container still starts in the init container sequence, it does not wait
for the container to complete before proceeding to the next init
container. Instead, the next init container starts immediately after this
init container is started, or after any startupProbe has successfully
completed.

container if they share the same name and modifications are done via a
strategic merge patch.

The names of containers managed by the operator are:
* `prometheus`
* `config-reloader`
* `thanos-sidecar`

Overriding containers is entirely outside the scope of what the
maintainers will support and by doing so, you accept that this behaviour
may break at any time without notice.

"%,
        restartPolicy | optional | String | doc m%"
RestartPolicy defines the restart behavior of individual containers in a pod.
This field may only be set for init containers, and the only allowed value is "Always".
For non-init containers or when this field is not specified,
the restart behavior is defined by the Pod's restart policy and the container type.
Setting the RestartPolicy as "Always" for the init container will have the following effect:
this init container will be continually restarted on
exit until all regular containers have terminated. Once all regular
containers have completed, all init containers with restartPolicy "Always"
will be shut down. This lifecycle differs from normal init containers and
is often referred to as a "sidecar" container. Although this init
container still starts in the init container sequence, it does not wait
for the container to complete before proceeding to the next init
container. Instead, the next init container starts immediately after this
init container is started, or after any startupProbe has successfully
completed.

InitContainers allows injecting initContainers to the Pod definition. Those
can be used to e.g.  fetch secrets for injection into the Prometheus
configuration from external sources. Any errors during the execution of
an initContainer will lead to a restart of the Pod. More info:
https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/init-containers/
InitContainers described here modify an operator generated init
containers if they share the same name and modifications are done via a
strategic merge patch.

The names of init container name managed by the operator are:

Overriding init containers is entirely outside the scope of what the
maintainers will support and by doing so, you accept that this behaviour
may break at any time without notice.

Some volume types allow the Kubelet to change the ownership of that volume
to be owned by the pod:

1. The owning GID will be the FSGroup
2. The setgid bit is set (new files created in the volume will be owned by FSGroup)
3. The permission bits are OR'd with rw-rw----

If unset, the Kubelet will not modify the ownership and permissions of any volume.
Note that this field cannot be set when spec.os.name is windows.
"%,
        fsGroupChangePolicy | optional | String | doc m%"
fsGroupChangePolicy defines behavior of changing ownership and permission of the volume
before being exposed inside Pod. This field will only apply to
volume types which support fsGroup based ownership(and permissions).
It will have no effect on ephemeral volume types such as: secret, configmaps
and emptydir.
Valid values are "OnRootMismatch" and "Always". If not specified, "Always" is used.
Note that this field cannot be set when spec.os.name is windows.
"%,

Note that this field cannot be set when spec.os.name is windows.
"%,
        runAsNonRoot | optional | Bool | doc m%"
Indicates that the container must run as a non-root user.
If true, the Kubelet will validate the image at runtime to ensure that it
does not run as UID 0 (root) and fail to start the container if it does.
If unset or false, no such validation will be performed.
May also be set in SecurityContext.  If set in both SecurityContext and
PodSecurityContext, the value specified in SecurityContext takes precedence.
"%,
        runAsUser | optional | Number | doc m%"

Defaults to user specified in image metadata if unspecified.
May also be set in SecurityContext.  If set in both SecurityContext and
PodSecurityContext, the value specified in SecurityContext takes precedence
for that container.
Note that this field cannot be set when spec.os.name is windows.
"%,
        seLinuxChangePolicy | optional | String | doc m%"
seLinuxChangePolicy defines how the container's SELinux label is applied to all volumes used by the Pod.
It has no effect on nodes that do not support SELinux or to volumes does not support SELinux.
Valid values are "MountOption" and "Recursive".

"Recursive" means relabeling of all files on all Pod volumes by the container runtime.
This may be slow for large volumes, but allows mixing privileged and unprivileged Pods sharing the same volume on the same node.

"MountOption" mounts all eligible Pod volumes with `-o context` mount option.
This requires all Pods that share the same volume to use the same SELinux label.
It is not possible to share the same volume among privileged and unprivileged Pods.
Eligible volumes are in-tree FibreChannel and iSCSI volumes, and all CSI volumes
whose CSI driver announces SELinux support by setting spec.seLinuxMount: true in their
CSIDriver instance. Other volumes are always re-labelled recursively.
"MountOption" value is allowed only when SELinuxMount feature gate is enabled.

If not specified and SELinuxMount feature gate is enabled, "MountOption" is used.
If not specified and SELinuxMount feature gate is disabled, "MountOption" is used for ReadWriteOncePod volumes
and "Recursive" for all other volumes.

This field affects only Pods that have SELinux label set, either in PodSecurityContext or in SecurityContext of all containers.

All Pods that use the same volume should use the same seLinuxChangePolicy, otherwise some pods can get stuck in ContainerCreating state.
Note that this field cannot be set when spec.os.name is windows.

          user | optional | String | doc "User is a SELinux user label that applies to the container.",
        } | doc m%"
The SELinux context to be applied to all containers.
If unspecified, the container runtime will allocate a random SELinux context for each
container.  May also be set in SecurityContext.  If set in
both SecurityContext and PodSecurityContext, the value specified in SecurityContext
takes precedence for that container.
Note that this field cannot be set when spec.os.name is windows.
"%,
        seccompProfile | optional | {
          localhostProfile | optional | String | doc m%"
localhostProfile indicates a profile defined in a file on the node should be used.

A list of groups applied to the first process run in each container, in
addition to the container's primary GID and fsGroup (if specified).  If
the SupplementalGroupsPolicy feature is enabled, the
supplementalGroupsPolicy field determines whether these are in addition
to or instead of any group memberships defined in the container image.
If unspecified, no additional groups are added, though group memberships
defined in the container image may still be used, depending on the
supplementalGroupsPolicy field.
Note that this field cannot be set when spec.os.name is windows.
"%,
        supplementalGroupsPolicy | optional | String | doc m%"
Defines how supplemental groups of the first container processes are calculated.
Valid values are "Merge" and "Strict". If not specified, "Merge" is used.

          hostProcess | optional | Bool | doc m%"
HostProcess determines if a container should be run as a 'Host Process' container.
All of a Pod's containers must have the same effective HostProcess value
(it is not allowed to have a mix of HostProcess containers and non-HostProcess containers).
In addition, if HostProcess is true then HostNetwork must also be set to true.
"%,
          runAsUserName | optional | String | doc m%"
The UserName in Windows to run the entrypoint of the container process.
Defaults to the user specified in image metadata if unspecified.
May also be set in PodSecurityContext. If set in both SecurityContext and
PodSecurityContext, the value specified in SecurityContext takes precedence.

The name of the service name used by the underlying StatefulSet(s) as the governing service.
If defined, the Service  must be created before the Prometheus/PrometheusAgent resource in the same namespace and it must define a selector that matches the pod labels.
If empty, the operator will create and manage a headless service named `prometheus-operated` for Prometheus resources,
or `prometheus-agent-operated` for PrometheusAgent resources.
When deploying multiple Prometheus/PrometheusAgent resources in the same namespace, it is recommended to specify a different value for each.
See https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/statefulset/#stable-network-id for more details.
"%,
      shards | optional | Number | doc m%"
Number of shards to distribute the scraped targets onto.

`spec.replicas` multiplied by `spec.shards` is the total number of Pods
being created.

When not defined, the operator assumes only one shard.

Note that scaling down shards will not reshard data onto the remaining
instances, it must be manually moved. Increasing shards will not reshard
data either but it will continue to be available from the same
instances. To query globally, use either
* Thanos sidecar + querier for query federation and Thanos Ruler for rules.
* Remote-write to send metrics to a central location.

By default, the sharding of targets is performed on:
* The `__address__` target's metadata label for PodMonitor,
ServiceMonitor and ScrapeConfig resources.
* The `__param_target__` label for Probe resources.

Users can define their own sharding implementation by setting the
`__tmp_hash` label during the target discovery with relabeling
configuration (either in the monitoring resources or via scrape class).

You can also disable sharding on a specific target by setting the
`__tmp_disable_sharding` label with relabeling configuration. When
the label value isn't empty, all Prometheus shards will scrape the target.

dataSourceRef specifies the object from which to populate the volume with data, if a non-empty
volume is desired. This may be any object from a non-empty API group (non
core object) or a PersistentVolumeClaim object.
When this field is specified, volume binding will only succeed if the type of
the specified object matches some installed volume populator or dynamic
provisioner.
This field will replace the functionality of the dataSource field and as such
if both fields are non-empty, they must have the same value. For backwards
compatibility, when namespace isn't specified in dataSourceRef,
both fields (dataSource and dataSourceRef) will be set to the same
value automatically if one of them is empty and the other is non-empty.
When namespace is specified in dataSourceRef,
dataSource isn't set to the same value and must be empty.
There are three important differences between dataSource and dataSourceRef:
* While dataSource only allows two specific types of objects, dataSourceRef
  allows any non-core object, as well as PersistentVolumeClaim objects.
* While dataSource ignores disallowed values (dropping them), dataSourceRef
  preserves all values, and generates an error if a disallowed value is
  specified.
* While dataSource only allows local objects, dataSourceRef allows objects
  in any namespaces.
(Beta) Using this field requires the AnyVolumeDataSource feature gate to be enabled.

Will be used to create a stand-alone PVC to provision the volume.
The pod in which this EphemeralVolumeSource is embedded will be the
owner of the PVC, i.e. the PVC will be deleted together with the
pod.  The name of the PVC will be `<pod name>-<volume name>` where
`<volume name>` is the name from the `PodSpec.Volumes` array
entry. Pod validation will reject the pod if the concatenated name
is not valid for a PVC (for example, too long).

An existing PVC with that name that is not owned by the pod
will *not* be used for the pod to avoid using an unrelated
volume by mistake. Starting the pod is then blocked until
the unrelated PVC is removed. If such a pre-created PVC is
meant to be used by the pod, the PVC has to updated with an
owner reference to the pod once the pod exists. Normally
this should not be necessary, but it may be useful when
manually reconstructing a broken cluster.

dataSourceRef specifies the object from which to populate the volume with data, if a non-empty

core object) or a PersistentVolumeClaim object.
When this field is specified, volume binding will only succeed if the type of
the specified object matches some installed volume populator or dynamic
provisioner.
This field will replace the functionality of the dataSource field and as such
if both fields are non-empty, they must have the same value. For backwards
compatibility, when namespace isn't specified in dataSourceRef,
both fields (dataSource and dataSourceRef) will be set to the same
value automatically if one of them is empty and the other is non-empty.
When namespace is specified in dataSourceRef,
dataSource isn't set to the same value and must be empty.
There are three important differences between dataSource and dataSourceRef:
* While dataSource only allows two specific types of objects, dataSourceRef
  allows any non-core object, as well as PersistentVolumeClaim objects.
* While dataSource ignores disallowed values (dropping them), dataSourceRef
  preserves all values, and generates an error if a disallowed value is
  specified.
* While dataSource only allows local objects, dataSourceRef allows objects
  in any namespaces.

allocatedResourceStatuses stores status of resource being resized for the given PVC.
Key names follow standard Kubernetes label syntax. Valid values are either:
	* Un-prefixed keys:
		- storage - the capacity of the volume.
	* Custom resources must use implementation-defined prefixed names such as "example.com/my-custom-resource"
Apart from above values - keys that are unprefixed or have kubernetes.io prefix are considered
reserved and hence may not be used.

ClaimResourceStatus can be in any of following states:
	- ControllerResizeInProgress:
		State set when resize controller starts resizing the volume in control-plane.
	- ControllerResizeFailed:
		State set when resize has failed in resize controller with a terminal error.
	- NodeResizePending:
		State set when resize controller has finished resizing the volume but further resizing of
		volume is needed on the node.
	- NodeResizeInProgress:
		State set when kubelet starts resizing the volume.
	- NodeResizeFailed:
		State set when resizing has failed in kubelet with a terminal error. Transient errors don't set
		NodeResizeFailed.
For example: if expanding a PVC for more capacity - this field can be one of the following states:
	- pvc.status.allocatedResourceStatus['storage'] = "ControllerResizeInProgress"
     - pvc.status.allocatedResourceStatus['storage'] = "ControllerResizeFailed"

     - pvc.status.allocatedResourceStatus['storage'] = "NodeResizeInProgress"
     - pvc.status.allocatedResourceStatus['storage'] = "NodeResizeFailed"
When this field is not set, it means that no resize operation is in progress for the given PVC.

A controller that receives PVC update with previously unknown resourceName or ClaimResourceStatus
should ignore the update for the purpose it was designed. For example - a controller that
only is responsible for resizing capacity of the volume, should ignore PVC updates that change other valid
resources associated with PVC.

This is an alpha field and requires enabling RecoverVolumeExpansionFailure feature.
"%,

	* Custom resources must use implementation-defined prefixed names such as "example.com/my-custom-resource"
Apart from above values - keys that are unprefixed or have kubernetes.io prefix are considered
reserved and hence may not be used.

Capacity reported here may be larger than the actual capacity when a volume expansion operation
is requested.
For storage quota, the larger value from allocatedResources and PVC.spec.resources is used.
If allocatedResources is not set, PVC.spec.resources alone is used for quota calculation.
If a volume expansion capacity request is lowered, allocatedResources is only
lowered if there are no expansion operations in progress and if the actual volume capacity
is equal or lower than the requested capacity.

A controller that receives PVC update with previously unknown resourceName
should ignore the update for the purpose it was designed. For example - a controller that

MatchLabelKeys is a set of pod label keys to select the pods over which
spreading will be calculated. The keys are used to lookup values from the
incoming pod labels, those key-value labels are ANDed with labelSelector
to select the group of existing pods over which spreading will be calculated
for the incoming pod. The same key is forbidden to exist in both MatchLabelKeys and LabelSelector.
MatchLabelKeys cannot be set when LabelSelector isn't set.
Keys that don't exist in the incoming pod labels will

This is a beta field and requires the MatchLabelKeysInPodTopologySpread feature gate to be enabled (enabled by default).
"%,
        maxSkew | Number | doc m%"
MaxSkew describes the degree to which pods may be unevenly distributed.
When `whenUnsatisfiable=DoNotSchedule`, it is the maximum permitted difference
between the number of matching pods in the target topology and the global minimum.
The global minimum is the minimum number of matching pods in an eligible domain
or zero if the number of eligible domains is less than MinDomains.
For example, in a 3-zone cluster, MaxSkew is set to 1, and pods with the same
labelSelector spread as 2/2/1:
In this case, the global minimum is 1.
| zone1 | zone2 | zone3 |
|  P P  |  P P  |   P   |
- if MaxSkew is 1, incoming pod can only be scheduled to zone3 to become 2/2/2;
scheduling it onto zone1(zone2) would make the ActualSkew(3-1) on zone1(zone2)
violate MaxSkew(1).
- if MaxSkew is 2, incoming pod can be scheduled onto any zone.
When `whenUnsatisfiable=ScheduleAnyway`, it is used to give higher precedence
to topologies that satisfy it.
It's a required field. Default value is 1 and 0 is not allowed.
"%,
        minDomains | optional | Number | doc m%"
MinDomains indicates a minimum number of eligible domains.
When the number of eligible domains with matching topology keys is less than minDomains,
Pod Topology Spread treats "global minimum" as 0, and then the calculation of Skew is performed.
And when the number of eligible domains with matching topology keys equals or greater than minDomains,
this value has no effect on scheduling.
As a result, when the number of eligible domains is less than minDomains,
scheduler won't schedule more than maxSkew Pods to those domains.
If value is nil, the constraint behaves as if MinDomains is equal to 1.
Valid values are integers greater than 0.
When value is not nil, WhenUnsatisfiable must be DoNotSchedule.

For example, in a 3-zone cluster, MaxSkew is set to 2, MinDomains is set to 5 and pods with the same
labelSelector spread as 2/2/2:
| zone1 | zone2 | zone3 |
|  P P  |  P P  |  P P  |
The number of domains is less than 5(MinDomains), so "global minimum" is treated as 0.
In this situation, new pod with the same labelSelector cannot be scheduled,
because computed skew will be 3(3 - 0) if new Pod is scheduled to any of the three zones,
it will violate MaxSkew.
"%,
        nodeAffinityPolicy | optional | String | doc m%"
NodeAffinityPolicy indicates how we will treat Pod's nodeAffinity/nodeSelector
when calculating pod topology spread skew. Options are:
- Honor: only nodes matching nodeAffinity/nodeSelector are included in the calculations.
- Ignore: nodeAffinity/nodeSelector are ignored. All nodes are included in the calculations.

If this value is nil, the behavior is equivalent to the Honor policy.
"%,
        nodeTaintsPolicy | optional | String | doc m%"
NodeTaintsPolicy indicates how we will treat node taints when calculating
pod topology spread skew. Options are:
- Honor: nodes without taints, along with tainted nodes for which the incoming pod
has a toleration, are included.
- Ignore: node taints are ignored. All nodes are included.

If this value is nil, the behavior is equivalent to the Ignore policy.
"%,
        topologyKey | String | doc m%"
TopologyKey is the key of node labels. Nodes that have a label with this key
and identical values are considered to be in the same topology.
We consider each <key, value> as a "bucket", and try to put balanced number
of pods into each bucket.
We define a domain as a particular instance of a topology.
Also, we define an eligible domain as a domain whose nodes meet the requirements of
nodeAffinityPolicy and nodeTaintsPolicy.
e.g. If TopologyKey is "kubernetes.io/hostname", each Node is a domain of that topology.
And, if TopologyKey is "topology.kubernetes.io/zone", each zone is a domain of that topology.

        whenUnsatisfiable | String | doc m%"
WhenUnsatisfiable indicates how to deal with a pod if it doesn't satisfy
the spread constraint.
- DoNotSchedule (default) tells the scheduler not to schedule it.
- ScheduleAnyway tells the scheduler to schedule the pod in any location,
  but giving higher precedence to topologies that would help reduce the
  skew.
A constraint is considered "Unsatisfiable" for an incoming pod
if and only if every possible node assignment for that pod would violate
"MaxSkew" on some topology.
For example, in a 3-zone cluster, MaxSkew is set to 1, and pods with the same
labelSelector spread as 3/1/1:
| zone1 | zone2 | zone3 |
| P P P |   P   |   P   |
If WhenUnsatisfiable is set to DoNotSchedule, incoming pod can only be scheduled
to zone2(zone3) to become 3/2/1(3/1/2) as ActualSkew(2-1) on zone2(zone3) satisfies
MaxSkew(1). In other words, the cluster can still be imbalanced, but scheduler
won't make it *more* imbalanced.

dataSourceRef specifies the object from which to populate the volume with data, if a non-empty
volume is desired. This may be any object from a non-empty API group (non
core object) or a PersistentVolumeClaim object.
When this field is specified, volume binding will only succeed if the type of
the specified object matches some installed volume populator or dynamic
provisioner.
This field will replace the functionality of the dataSource field and as such
if both fields are non-empty, they must have the same value. For backwards
compatibility, when namespace isn't specified in dataSourceRef,
both fields (dataSource and dataSourceRef) will be set to the same
value automatically if one of them is empty and the other is non-empty.
When namespace is specified in dataSourceRef,
dataSource isn't set to the same value and must be empty.
There are three important differences between dataSource and dataSourceRef:
* While dataSource only allows two specific types of objects, dataSourceRef
  allows any non-core object, as well as PersistentVolumeClaim objects.
* While dataSource ignores disallowed values (dropping them), dataSourceRef

Will be used to create a stand-alone PVC to provision the volume.
The pod in which this EphemeralVolumeSource is embedded will be the
owner of the PVC, i.e. the PVC will be deleted together with the
pod.  The name of the PVC will be `<pod name>-<volume name>` where
`<volume name>` is the name from the `PodSpec.Volumes` array
entry. Pod validation will reject the pod if the concatenated name
is not valid for a PVC (for example, too long).

An existing PVC with that name that is not owned by the pod
will *not* be used for the pod to avoid using an unrelated
volume by mistake. Starting the pod is then blocked until
the unrelated PVC is removed. If such a pre-created PVC is
meant to be used by the pod, the PVC has to updated with an
owner reference to the pod once the pod exists. Normally
this should not be necessary, but it may be useful when
manually reconstructing a broken cluster.

This field is read-only and no changes will be made by Kubernetes
to the PVC after it has been created.

Required, must not be nil.
"%,
        } | doc m%"
ephemeral represents a volume that is handled by a cluster storage driver.
The volume's lifecycle is tied to the pod that defines it - it will be created before the pod starts,
and deleted when the pod is removed.

Use this if:
a) the volume is only needed while the pod runs,
b) features of normal volumes like restoring from snapshot or capacity
   tracking are needed,
c) the storage driver is specified through a storage class, and
d) the storage driver supports dynamic volume provisioning through
   a PersistentVolumeClaim (see EphemeralVolumeSource for more
   information on the connection between this volume type
   and PersistentVolumeClaim).

Use PersistentVolumeClaim or one of the vendor-specific
APIs for volumes that persist for longer than the lifecycle
of an individual pod.

Use CSI for light-weight local ephemeral volumes if the CSI driver is meant to
be used that way - see the documentation of the driver for
more information.

A pod can use both types of ephemeral volumes and
persistent volumes at the same time.

This field is optional to allow higher level config management to default or override
container images in workload controllers like Deployments and StatefulSets.
"%,
        } | doc m%"
image represents an OCI object (a container image or artifact) pulled and mounted on the kubelet's host machine.
The volume is resolved at pod startup depending on which PullPolicy value is provided:

- Always: the kubelet always attempts to pull the reference. Container creation will fail If the pull fails.
- Never: the kubelet never pulls the reference and only uses a local image or artifact. Container creation will fail if the reference isn't present.
- IfNotPresent: the kubelet pulls if the reference isn't already present on disk. Container creation will fail if the reference isn't present and the pull fails.

The volume gets re-resolved if the pod gets deleted and recreated, which means that new remote content will become available on pod recreation.
A failure to resolve or pull the image during pod startup will block containers from starting and may add significant latency. Failures will be retried using normal volume backoff and will be reported on the pod reason and message.
The types of objects that may be mounted by this volume are defined by the container runtime implementation on a host machine and at minimum must include all valid types supported by the container image field.
The OCI object gets mounted in a single directory (spec.containers[*].volumeMounts.mountPath) by merging the manifest layers in the same way as for container images.
The volume will be mounted read-only (ro) and non-executable files (noexec).
Sub path mounts for containers are not supported (spec.containers[*].volumeMounts.subpath) before 1.33.
The field spec.securityContext.fsGroupChangePolicy has no effect on this volume type.

    apiVersion | optional | String | doc m%"
APIVersion defines the versioned schema of this representation of an object.
Servers should convert recognized schemas to the latest internal value, and
may reject unrecognized values.

"%,
    kind | optional | String | doc m%"
Kind is a string value representing the REST resource this object represents.
Servers may infer this from the endpoint the client submits requests to.
Cannot be updated.
In CamelCase.

      envSourceContainerName | optional | String,
      failedJobsHistoryLimit | optional | Number,
      jobTargetRef | {
        activeDeadlineSeconds | optional | Number | doc m%"
Specifies the duration in seconds relative to the startTime that the job
may be continuously active before the system tries to terminate it; value
must be positive integer. If a Job is suspended (at creation or through an
update), this timer will effectively be stopped and reset when the Job is
resumed again.
"%,
        backoffLimit | optional | Number | doc m%"
Specifies the number of retries before marking this job failed.
Defaults to 6
"%,
        backoffLimitPerIndex | optional | Number | doc m%"
Specifies the limit for the number of retries within an
index before marking this index as failed. When enabled the number of
failures per index is kept in the pod's
batch.kubernetes.io/job-index-failure-count annotation. It can only
be set when Job's completionMode=Indexed, and the Pod's restart
policy is Never. The field is immutable.
This field is beta-level. It can be used when the `JobBackoffLimitPerIndex`
feature gate is enabled (enabled by default).
"%,
        completionMode | optional | String | doc m%"
completionMode specifies how Pod completions are tracked. It can be
`NonIndexed` (default) or `Indexed`.

`NonIndexed` means that the Job is considered complete when there have
been .spec.completions successfully completed Pods. Each Pod completion is
homologous to each other.

`Indexed` means that the Pods of a
Job get an associated completion index from 0 to (.spec.completions - 1),
available in the annotation batch.kubernetes.io/job-completion-index.
The Job is considered complete when there is one successfully completed Pod
for each index.
When value is `Indexed`, .spec.completions must be specified and
`.spec.parallelism` must be less than or equal to 10^5.
In addition, The Pod name takes the form
`$(job-name)-$(index)-$(random-string)`,
the Pod hostname takes the form `$(job-name)-$(index)`.

More completion modes can be added in the future.
If the Job controller observes a mode that it doesn't recognize, which
is possible during upgrades due to version skew, the controller
skips updates for the Job.
"%,
        completions | optional | Number | doc m%"
Specifies the desired number of successfully finished pods the
job should be run with.  Setting to null means that the success of any
pod signals the success of all pods, and allows parallelism to have any positive
value.  Setting to 1 means that parallelism is limited to 1 and the success of that
pod signals the success of the job.
More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/jobs-run-to-completion/
"%,
        managedBy | optional | String | doc m%"
ManagedBy field indicates the controller that manages a Job. The k8s Job
controller reconciles jobs which don't have this field at all or the field
value is the reserved string `kubernetes.io/job-controller`, but skips
reconciling Jobs with a custom value for this field.
The value must be a valid domain-prefixed path (e.g. acme.io/foo) -
all characters before the first "/" must be a valid subdomain as defined
by RFC 1123. All characters trailing the first "/" must be valid HTTP Path
characters as defined by RFC 3986. The value cannot exceed 63 characters.
This field is immutable.

This field is alpha-level. The job controller accepts setting the field
when the feature gate JobManagedBy is enabled (disabled by default).
"%,
        manualSelector | optional | Bool | doc m%"
manualSelector controls generation of pod labels and pod selectors.
Leave `manualSelector` unset unless you are certain what you are doing.
When false or unset, the system pick labels unique to this job
and appends those labels to the pod template.  When true,
the user is responsible for picking unique labels and specifying
the selector.  Failure to pick a unique label may cause this
and other jobs to not function correctly.  However, You may see
`manualSelector=true` in jobs that were created with the old `extensions/v1beta1`
API.
More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/jobs-run-to-completion/#specifying-your-own-pod-selector
"%,
        maxFailedIndexes | optional | Number | doc m%"
Specifies the maximal number of failed indexes before marking the Job as
failed, when backoffLimitPerIndex is set. Once the number of failed
indexes exceeds this number the entire Job is marked as Failed and its
execution is terminated. When left as null the job continues execution of
all of its indexes and is marked with the `Complete` Job condition.
It can only be specified when backoffLimitPerIndex is set.
It can be null or up to completions. It is required and must be
less than or equal to 10^4 when is completions greater than 10^5.
This field is beta-level. It can be used when the `JobBackoffLimitPerIndex`
feature gate is enabled (enabled by default).
"%,
        parallelism | optional | Number | doc m%"
Specifies the maximum desired number of pods the job should
run at any given time. The actual number of pods running in steady state will
be less than this number when ((.spec.completions - .status.successful) < .spec.parallelism),
i.e. when the work left to do is less than max parallelism.

"%,
        podFailurePolicy | optional | {
          rules | Array {
            action | String | doc m%"
Specifies the action taken on a pod failure when the requirements are satisfied.
Possible values are:

- FailJob: indicates that the pod's job is marked as Failed and all
  running pods are terminated.
- FailIndex: indicates that the pod's index is marked as Failed and will
  not be restarted.
  This value is beta-level. It can be used when the
  `JobBackoffLimitPerIndex` feature gate is enabled (enabled by default).
- Ignore: indicates that the counter towards the .backoffLimit is not
  incremented and a replacement pod is created.
- Count: indicates that the pod is handled in the default way - the
  counter towards the .backoffLimit is incremented.
Additional values are considered to be added in the future. Clients should
react to an unknown action by skipping the rule.
"%,
            onExitCodes | optional | {
              containerName | optional | String | doc m%"
Restricts the check for exit codes to the container with the
specified name. When null, the rule applies to all containers.
When specified, it should match one the container or initContainer
names in the pod template.
"%,
              operator | String | doc m%"
Represents the relationship between the container exit code(s) and the
specified values. Containers completed with success (exit code 0) are
excluded from the requirement check. Possible values are:

- In: the requirement is satisfied if at least one container exit code
  (might be multiple if there are multiple containers not restricted
  by the 'containerName' field) is in the set of specified values.
- NotIn: the requirement is satisfied if at least one container exit code
  (might be multiple if there are multiple containers not restricted
  by the 'containerName' field) is not in the set of specified values.
Additional values are considered to be added in the future. Clients should
react to an unknown operator by assuming the requirement is not satisfied.
"%,
              values | Array Number | doc m%"
Specifies the set of values. Each returned container exit code (might be
multiple in case of multiple containers) is checked against this set of
values with respect to the operator. The list of values must be ordered
and must not contain duplicates. Value '0' cannot be used for the In operator.
At least one element is required. At most 255 elements are allowed.
"%,

            onPodConditions | optional | Array {
              status | String | doc m%"
Specifies the required Pod condition status. To match a pod condition
it is required that the specified status equals the pod condition status.
Defaults to True.
"%,
              type | String | doc m%"
Specifies the required Pod condition type. To match a pod condition
it is required that specified type equals the pod condition type.
"%,
            } | doc m%"
Represents the requirement on the pod conditions. The requirement is represented
as a list of pod condition patterns. The requirement is satisfied if at
least one pattern matches an actual pod condition. At most 20 elements are allowed.
"%,
          } | doc m%"
A list of pod failure policy rules. The rules are evaluated in order.
Once a rule matches a Pod failure, the remaining of the rules are ignored.
When no rule matches the Pod failure, the default handling applies - the
counter of pod failures is incremented and it is checked against
the backoffLimit. At most 20 elements are allowed.
"%,
        } | doc m%"
Specifies the policy of handling failed pods. In particular, it allows to
specify the set of actions and conditions which need to be
satisfied to take the associated action.
If empty, the default behaviour applies - the counter of failed pods,
represented by the jobs's .status.failed field, is incremented and it is
checked against the backoffLimit. This field cannot be used in combination
with restartPolicy=OnFailure.
"%,
        podReplacementPolicy | optional | String | doc m%"
podReplacementPolicy specifies when to create replacement Pods.
Possible values are:
- TerminatingOrFailed means that we recreate pods
  when they are terminating (has a metadata.deletionTimestamp) or failed.
- Failed means to wait until a previously created Pod is fully terminated (has phase
  Failed or Succeeded) before creating a replacement Pod.

When using podFailurePolicy, Failed is the the only allowed value.
TerminatingOrFailed and Failed are allowed values when podFailurePolicy is not in use.
This is an beta field. To use this, enable the JobPodReplacementPolicy feature toggle.
This is on by default.

operator represents a key's relationship to a set of values.
Valid operators are In, NotIn, Exists and DoesNotExist.
"%,
            values | optional | Array String | doc m%"

matchLabels is a map of {key,value} pairs. A single {key,value} in the matchLabels
map is equivalent to an element of matchExpressions, whose key field is "key", the
operator is "In", and the values array contains only "value". The requirements are ANDed.
"%,
        } | doc m%"

"%,
        successPolicy | optional | {
          rules | Array {
            succeededCount | optional | Number | doc m%"
succeededCount specifies the minimal required size of the actual set of the succeeded indexes
for the Job. When succeededCount is used along with succeededIndexes, the check is
constrained only to the set of indexes specified by succeededIndexes.
For example, given that succeededIndexes is "1-4", succeededCount is "3",
and completed indexes are "1", "3", and "5", the Job isn't declared as succeeded
because only "1" and "3" indexes are considered in that rules.
When this field is null, this doesn't default to any value and
is never evaluated at any time.
When specified it needs to be a positive integer.
"%,
            succeededIndexes | optional | String | doc m%"
succeededIndexes specifies the set of indexes
which need to be contained in the actual set of the succeeded indexes for the Job.
The list of indexes must be within 0 to ".spec.completions-1" and
must not contain duplicates. At least one element is required.
The indexes are represented as intervals separated by commas.
The intervals can be a decimal integer or a pair of decimal integers separated by a hyphen.
The number are listed in represented by the first and last element of the series,
separated by a hyphen.
For example, if the completed indexes are 1, 3, 4, 5 and 7, they are
represented as "1,3-5,7".
When this field is null, this field doesn't default to any value
and is never evaluated at any time.
"%,
          } | doc m%"
rules represents the list of alternative rules for the declaring the Jobs
as successful before `.status.succeeded >= .spec.completions`. Once any of the rules are met,
the "SucceededCriteriaMet" condition is added, and the lingering pods are removed.
The terminal state for such a Job has the "Complete" condition.
Additionally, these rules are evaluated in order; Once the Job meets one of the rules,
other rules are ignored. At most 20 elements are allowed.
"%,
        } | doc m%"
successPolicy specifies the policy when the Job can be declared as succeeded.
If empty, the default behavior applies - the Job is declared as succeeded
only when the number of succeeded pods equals to the completions.
When the field is specified, it must be immutable and works only for the Indexed Jobs.
Once the Job meets the SuccessPolicy, the lingering pods are terminated.

This field is beta-level. To use this field, you must enable the
`JobSuccessPolicy` feature gate (enabled by default).
"%,
        suspend | optional | Bool | doc m%"
suspend specifies whether the Job controller should create Pods or not. If
a Job is created with suspend set to true, no Pods are created by the Job
controller. If a Job is suspended after creation (i.e. the flag goes from
false to true), the Job controller will delete all active Pods associated
with this Job. Users must design their workload to gracefully handle this.
Suspending a Job will reset the StartTime field of the Job, effectively
resetting the ActiveDeadlineSeconds timer too. Defaults to false.

The scheduler will prefer to schedule pods to nodes that satisfy
the affinity expressions specified by this field, but it may choose
a node that violates one or more of the expressions. The node that is
most preferred is the one with the greatest sum of weights, i.e.

MatchLabelKeys is a set of pod label keys to select which pods will
be taken into consideration. The keys are used to lookup values from the
incoming pod labels, those key-value labels are merged with `labelSelector` as `key in (value)`

PreStop is called immediately before a container is terminated due to an
API request or management event such as liveness/startup probe failure,
preemption, resource contention, etc. The handler is not called if the
container crashes or exits. The Pod's termination grace period countdown begins before the
PreStop hook is executed. Regardless of the outcome of the handler, the
container will eventually terminate within the Pod's termination grace
period (unless delayed by finalizers). Other management of the container blocks until the hook completes
or until the termination grace period is reached.

RestartPolicy defines the restart behavior of individual containers in a pod.
This field may only be set for init containers, and the only allowed value is "Always".
For non-init containers or when this field is not specified,
the restart behavior is defined by the Pod's restart policy and the container type.
Setting the RestartPolicy as "Always" for the init container will have the following effect:
this init container will be continually restarted on
exit until all regular containers have terminated. Once all regular
containers have completed, all init containers with restartPolicy "Always"
will be shut down. This lifecycle differs from normal init containers and
is often referred to as a "sidecar" container. Although this init
container still starts in the init container sequence, it does not wait
for the container to complete before proceeding to the next init
container. Instead, the next init container starts immediately after this
init container is started, or after any startupProbe has successfully
completed.

to a single $, which allows for escaping the $(VAR_NAME) syntax: i.e. "$$(VAR_NAME)" will
produce the string literal "$(VAR_NAME)". Escaped references will never be expanded, regardless
of whether the variable exists or not. Cannot be updated.

RestartPolicy defines the restart behavior of individual containers in a pod.
This field may only be set for init containers, and the only allowed value is "Always".
For non-init containers or when this field is not specified,
the restart behavior is defined by the Pod's restart policy and the container type.
Setting the RestartPolicy as "Always" for the init container will have the following effect:
this init container will be continually restarted on
exit until all regular containers have terminated. Once all regular
containers have completed, all init containers with restartPolicy "Always"
will be shut down. This lifecycle differs from normal init containers and
is often referred to as a "sidecar" container. Although this init
container still starts in the init container sequence, it does not wait
for the container to complete before proceeding to the next init
container. Instead, the next init container starts immediately after this
init container is started, or after any startupProbe has successfully
completed.

Default to false.
"%,
            shareProcessNamespace | optional | Bool | doc m%"

map is equivalent to an element of matchExpressions, whose key field is "key", the
operator is "In", and the values array contains only "value". The requirements are ANDed.
"%,
              } | doc m%"
LabelSelector is used to find matching pods.
Pods that match this label selector are counted to determine the number of pods
in their corresponding topology domain.
"%,
              matchLabelKeys | optional | Array String | doc m%"
MatchLabelKeys is a set of pod label keys to select the pods over which
spreading will be calculated. The keys are used to lookup values from the
incoming pod labels, those key-value labels are ANDed with labelSelector
to select the group of existing pods over which spreading will be calculated
for the incoming pod. The same key is forbidden to exist in both MatchLabelKeys and LabelSelector.
MatchLabelKeys cannot be set when LabelSelector isn't set.
Keys that don't exist in the incoming pod labels will
be ignored. A null or empty list means only match against labelSelector.

This is a beta field and requires the MatchLabelKeysInPodTopologySpread feature gate to be enabled (enabled by default).
"%,
              maxSkew | Number | doc m%"
MaxSkew describes the degree to which pods may be unevenly distributed.
When `whenUnsatisfiable=DoNotSchedule`, it is the maximum permitted difference
between the number of matching pods in the target topology and the global minimum.
The global minimum is the minimum number of matching pods in an eligible domain
or zero if the number of eligible domains is less than MinDomains.
For example, in a 3-zone cluster, MaxSkew is set to 1, and pods with the same
labelSelector spread as 2/2/1:
In this case, the global minimum is 1.
| zone1 | zone2 | zone3 |
|  P P  |  P P  |   P   |
- if MaxSkew is 1, incoming pod can only be scheduled to zone3 to become 2/2/2;
scheduling it onto zone1(zone2) would make the ActualSkew(3-1) on zone1(zone2)
violate MaxSkew(1).
- if MaxSkew is 2, incoming pod can be scheduled onto any zone.
When `whenUnsatisfiable=ScheduleAnyway`, it is used to give higher precedence
to topologies that satisfy it.
It's a required field. Default value is 1 and 0 is not allowed.
"%,
              minDomains | optional | Number | doc m%"
MinDomains indicates a minimum number of eligible domains.
When the number of eligible domains with matching topology keys is less than minDomains,
Pod Topology Spread treats "global minimum" as 0, and then the calculation of Skew is performed.
And when the number of eligible domains with matching topology keys equals or greater than minDomains,
this value has no effect on scheduling.
As a result, when the number of eligible domains is less than minDomains,
scheduler won't schedule more than maxSkew Pods to those domains.
If value is nil, the constraint behaves as if MinDomains is equal to 1.
Valid values are integers greater than 0.
When value is not nil, WhenUnsatisfiable must be DoNotSchedule.

For example, in a 3-zone cluster, MaxSkew is set to 2, MinDomains is set to 5 and pods with the same
labelSelector spread as 2/2/2:
| zone1 | zone2 | zone3 |
|  P P  |  P P  |  P P  |
The number of domains is less than 5(MinDomains), so "global minimum" is treated as 0.
In this situation, new pod with the same labelSelector cannot be scheduled,
because computed skew will be 3(3 - 0) if new Pod is scheduled to any of the three zones,
it will violate MaxSkew.
"%,
              nodeAffinityPolicy | optional | String | doc m%"
NodeAffinityPolicy indicates how we will treat Pod's nodeAffinity/nodeSelector
when calculating pod topology spread skew. Options are:
- Honor: only nodes matching nodeAffinity/nodeSelector are included in the calculations.
- Ignore: nodeAffinity/nodeSelector are ignored. All nodes are included in the calculations.

If this value is nil, the behavior is equivalent to the Honor policy.
This is a beta-level feature default enabled by the NodeInclusionPolicyInPodTopologySpread feature flag.
"%,
              nodeTaintsPolicy | optional | String | doc m%"
NodeTaintsPolicy indicates how we will treat node taints when calculating
pod topology spread skew. Options are:
- Honor: nodes without taints, along with tainted nodes for which the incoming pod
has a toleration, are included.
- Ignore: node taints are ignored. All nodes are included.

If this value is nil, the behavior is equivalent to the Ignore policy.
This is a beta-level feature default enabled by the NodeInclusionPolicyInPodTopologySpread feature flag.
"%,
              topologyKey | String | doc m%"
TopologyKey is the key of node labels. Nodes that have a label with this key
and identical values are considered to be in the same topology.
We consider each <key, value> as a "bucket", and try to put balanced number
of pods into each bucket.
We define a domain as a particular instance of a topology.
Also, we define an eligible domain as a domain whose nodes meet the requirements of
nodeAffinityPolicy and nodeTaintsPolicy.
e.g. If TopologyKey is "kubernetes.io/hostname", each Node is a domain of that topology.
And, if TopologyKey is "topology.kubernetes.io/zone", each zone is a domain of that topology.
It's a required field.
"%,
              whenUnsatisfiable | String | doc m%"
WhenUnsatisfiable indicates how to deal with a pod if it doesn't satisfy
the spread constraint.
- DoNotSchedule (default) tells the scheduler not to schedule it.
- ScheduleAnyway tells the scheduler to schedule the pod in any location,
  but giving higher precedence to topologies that would help reduce the
  skew.
A constraint is considered "Unsatisfiable" for an incoming pod
if and only if every possible node assignment for that pod would violate
"MaxSkew" on some topology.
For example, in a 3-zone cluster, MaxSkew is set to 1, and pods with the same
labelSelector spread as 3/1/1:
| zone1 | zone2 | zone3 |
| P P P |   P   |   P   |
If WhenUnsatisfiable is set to DoNotSchedule, incoming pod can only be scheduled
to zone2(zone3) to become 3/2/1(3/1/2) as ActualSkew(2-1) on zone2(zone3) satisfies
MaxSkew(1). In other words, the cluster can still be imbalanced, but scheduler
won't make it *more* imbalanced.
It's a required field.
"%,
            } | doc m%"
TopologySpreadConstraints describes how a group of pods ought to spread across topology
domains. Scheduler will schedule pods in a way which abides by the constraints.
All topologySpreadConstraints are ANDed.

dataSourceRef specifies the object from which to populate the volume with data, if a non-empty
volume is desired. This may be any object from a non-empty API group (non
core object) or a PersistentVolumeClaim object.
When this field is specified, volume binding will only succeed if the type of
the specified object matches some installed volume populator or dynamic
provisioner.
This field will replace the functionality of the dataSource field and as such
if both fields are non-empty, they must have the same value. For backwards
compatibility, when namespace isn't specified in dataSourceRef,
both fields (dataSource and dataSourceRef) will be set to the same
value automatically if one of them is empty and the other is non-empty.
When namespace is specified in dataSourceRef,
dataSource isn't set to the same value and must be empty.
There are three important differences between dataSource and dataSourceRef:
* While dataSource only allows two specific types of objects, dataSourceRef
  allows any non-core object, as well as PersistentVolumeClaim objects.
* While dataSource ignores disallowed values (dropping them), dataSourceRef
  preserves all values, and generates an error if a disallowed value is
  specified.
* While dataSource only allows local objects, dataSourceRef allows objects
  in any namespaces.

Will be used to create a stand-alone PVC to provision the volume.
The pod in which this EphemeralVolumeSource is embedded will be the
owner of the PVC, i.e. the PVC will be deleted together with the
pod.  The name of the PVC will be `<pod name>-<volume name>` where
`<volume name>` is the name from the `PodSpec.Volumes` array
entry. Pod validation will reject the pod if the concatenated name
is not valid for a PVC (for example, too long).

An existing PVC with that name that is not owned by the pod
will *not* be used for the pod to avoid using an unrelated
volume by mistake. Starting the pod is then blocked until
the unrelated PVC is removed. If such a pre-created PVC is
meant to be used by the pod, the PVC has to updated with an
owner reference to the pod once the pod exists. Normally
this should not be necessary, but it may be useful when
manually reconstructing a broken cluster.

This field is read-only and no changes will be made by Kubernetes
to the PVC after it has been created.

Required, must not be nil.
"%,
              } | doc m%"
ephemeral represents a volume that is handled by a cluster storage driver.
The volume's lifecycle is tied to the pod that defines it - it will be created before the pod starts,
and deleted when the pod is removed.

Use this if:
a) the volume is only needed while the pod runs,
b) features of normal volumes like restoring from snapshot or capacity
   tracking are needed,
c) the storage driver is specified through a storage class, and
d) the storage driver supports dynamic volume provisioning through
   a PersistentVolumeClaim (see EphemeralVolumeSource for more
   information on the connection between this volume type
   and PersistentVolumeClaim).

Use PersistentVolumeClaim or one of the vendor-specific
APIs for volumes that persist for longer than the lifecycle
of an individual pod.

Use CSI for light-weight local ephemeral volumes if the CSI driver is meant to
be used that way - see the documentation of the driver for
more information.

A pod can use both types of ephemeral volumes and
persistent volumes at the same time.

"%,
              } | doc m%"
image represents an OCI object (a container image or artifact) pulled and mounted on the kubelet's host machine.
The volume is resolved at pod startup depending on which PullPolicy value is provided:

- Always: the kubelet always attempts to pull the reference. Container creation will fail If the pull fails.
- Never: the kubelet never pulls the reference and only uses a local image or artifact. Container creation will fail if the reference isn't present.
- IfNotPresent: the kubelet pulls if the reference isn't already present on disk. Container creation will fail if the reference isn't present and the pull fails.

The volume gets re-resolved if the pod gets deleted and recreated, which means that new remote content will become available on pod recreation.
A failure to resolve or pull the image during pod startup will block containers from starting and may add significant latency. Failures will be retried using normal volume backoff and will be reported on the pod reason and message.
The types of objects that may be mounted by this volume are defined by the container runtime implementation on a host machine and at minimum must include all valid types supported by the container image field.
The OCI object gets mounted in a single directory (spec.containers[*].volumeMounts.mountPath) by merging the manifest layers in the same way as for container images.
The volume will be mounted read-only (ro) and non-executable files (noexec).
Sub path mounts for containers are not supported (spec.containers[*].volumeMounts.subpath).
The field spec.securityContext.fsGroupChangePolicy has no effect on this volume type.

ttlSecondsAfterFinished limits the lifetime of a Job that has finished
execution (either Complete or Failed). If this field is set,
ttlSecondsAfterFinished after the Job finishes, it is eligible to be
automatically deleted. When the Job is being deleted, its lifecycle
guarantees (e.g. finalizers) will be honored. If this field is unset,
the Job won't be automatically deleted. If this field is set to zero,
the Job becomes eligible to be deleted immediately after it finishes.
